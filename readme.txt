== Description ==
This plugin is a WordPress Google Summer of Code 2014 project. See the <a href="http://celloexpressions.com/blog/gsoc-project-proposal-menu-customizer/">initial proposal</a> and <a href="http://celloexpressions.com/blog/gsoc-menu-customizer-revised-schedulescope/">adjusted scope/schedule</a>.

The Menu Customizer adds custom menu management to the Theme Customizer. It is partially functional and in alpha development until further notice; please don't try to run it on a production site. Certain features currently require core patches, and the plugin requires the latest trunk version of WordPress (4.0).

Several improvements to both Menus and the Theme Customizer are in the works as a part of this project. Many of them are listed <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/my-patches?USER=celloexpressions">here</a>.

1. Take the easy route and install through the WordPress plugin adder OR
1. Download the .zip file and upload the unzipped folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the Theme Customizer (Appearance -> Customize) to customize your menus with live previews (currently only partially functional).
